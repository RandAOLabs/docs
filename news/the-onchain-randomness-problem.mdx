> “There is no truly random. There is only unpredictable.”

In the world of blockchain, randomness isn’t just hard — it’s inherently compromised by the very properties that make blockchains powerful: transparency and determinism.

Randomness in a blockchain context has to be **unpredictable** — and more importantly, **equally unpredictable to all participants**. That means no party should have privileged access to influence or predict the outcome of a random event. This is fundamentally at odds with trustless, permissionless systems.

Random numbers are vital: from cryptographic keys to fair games of chance, and even to video game mechanics like loot boxes. But onchain, randomness becomes a minefield of trust assumptions and attack vectors.

#### Why Traditional RNG Fails Onchain

Blockchains, by design, are public and deterministic. This means that any randomness derived from onchain data — like block hashes or timestamps — is inherently predictable or manipulable by miners and validators.

Enter **Verifiable Random Functions (VRFs)**. These can generate random values in a cryptographically secure way, but the issue lies in **who operates them**. Whoever runs the VRF gains advanced knowledge or control over outcomes — violating the principle of equal unpredictability.

**Oracles**, another workaround, centralize trust even further. Users must trust that the oracle operator hasn’t gamed the result — like drawing winning lottery numbers that conveniently benefit them.

#### So What’s the Fix?

We’ve developed **RANDAO** — a permissionless randomness protocol powered by a decentralized network. It’s based on a **modified commit-reveal** scheme, enhanced with **time-unlocked commitments** and secured by a network of **$RNG miners**. These miners provide and solve **Timelock puzzles** onchain, creating a transparent and trustless pipeline of unpredictable randomness.

The goal? To make **onchain randomness truly permissionless, transparent, and tamper-resistant** — opening the door for fairer games, stronger cryptography, and more secure dApps.
