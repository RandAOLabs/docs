## Related Work & Technical Foundations

Milestone 1 is focused on documenting the **minimum set of primitives, assumptions, and artifacts required to support protocol design** for **onchain randomness** in blockchain systems.

---

### Foundational Diagrams

We define:
- **System roles and data flow** involved in blockchain randomness  
- **Commit–reveal timing and verification boundaries** used in proof-of-randomness designs  

These diagrams serve as a shared reference for research and development, helping both engineers and decision-makers reason about how randomness is produced and verified onchain.

### Core Cryptographic Primitives

The research documents and evaluates established cryptographic primitives commonly used in **blockchain RNG** and verifiable randomness systems:
- **RSA**
- **Modular Exponentiation**
- **Euler’s Totient Function**
- **Timelock Puzzles**
- **Collision-Resistant Hash Functions**

These primitives form the basis for secure designs that answer practical questions such as how random numbers are generated in smart contracts and how **proof of randomness in crypto** can be verified.

Only well-understood, production-grade primitives are considered.

### Blockchain Context

This work is grounded in real blockchain constraints, including:
- **Smart contract execution limits**
- **Deterministic blockchain environments**
- **Onchain verification and gas costs**

These factors shape what is possible when building reliable randomness systems on networks like Bitcoin and EVM-based chains.

Milestone 1 is complete once these foundations are clearly defined and aligned across the team.
