## Milestone 1.1: Operationalizing Onchain Randomness

Most conversations around **blockchain randomness** focus on cryptography alone.  
That matters — but equally important is **operational reliability**: how randomness systems are built, tested, and deployed in practice.

Milestone 1.1 tightens that loop.

Think of it like moving from a prototype engine on a workbench to an engine mounted, tested, and running in a vehicle.  
This is how **onchain randomness** becomes dependable infrastructure rather than experimental tooling.

## Provider Registration: Joining the Network

Providers can now **register and join the RANDAO network**.

In real-world terms, this is onboarding power plants to the grid before electricity can flow.

Registration defines:
- Who is allowed to participate
- How providers are identified
- The foundation for accountable **proof of randomness in crypto**

This step enables decentralization without chaos — a prerequisite for any serious **blockchain RNG** system.

---

## Testing: Trust Starts in the Pipeline

All core logic is now covered by **unit tests running automatically in CI**.

This ensures:
- Every change is validated
- Regressions are caught early
- Cryptographic and protocol guarantees are enforced continuously

If randomness is the foundation, tests are the stress tests that ensure **proof of entropy in crypto** remains verifiable under change.

## Deployment: From Commit to Testnet

On merge to `main`, contracts now **deploy automatically to testnet**.

No manual steps.  
No “it worked on my machine.”  
Just deterministic execution.

This mirrors how mature infrastructure companies ship:
`code → tests → deploy → verify`

Operational discipline is what separates experimental randomness from reliable **blockchain randomness** you can build on.

## Closing Thoughts

We’re building RANDAO so builders never have to ask:
- *What is RNG in blockchain?*
- *How do I trust randomness onchain?*
- *How does this compare to Chainlink or Bitcoin’s randomness model?*

Instead, they can focus on what they’re building.

If you’re working on EVM, GameFi, NFTs, or any system that depends on **verifiable randomness**, I’d love your perspective.
