# Randomness Is Revenue: Why Onchain RNG Attracts High-TPS DApps

Most blockchains optimize for throughput, tooling, or marketing.  
Very few optimize for **what actually drives fee revenue**: the kinds of applications developers can safely build.

One of the most overlooked primitives in that equation is **onchain randomness**.

At RANDAO, we think about randomness the same way early internet architects thought about bandwidth—not flashy, but absolutely decisive.

## From Infrastructure to Income

Blockchains don’t earn fees because they exist.  
They earn fees because **applications generate transactions**.

High-TPS DApps—GameFi, NFT minting engines, onchain lotteries, prediction markets—share a common dependency:
they require **verifiable randomness** to function correctly and fairly.

Without secure blockchain RNG:
- Games leak value or get exploited  
- NFT mints get botted or manipulated  
- User trust erodes  
- Transaction volume stalls

With it, entirely new economic behaviors become possible.

## Why High-TPS DApps Mean Higher Fee Revenue

High-TPS DApps are not one-off launches.
They are *systems*—loops of interaction, competition, and replay.

That means:
- More transactions per user  
- Longer application lifecycles  
- Sustained fee generation for the underlying chain  

Randomness isn’t a cost center.
It’s a **multiplier on economic activity**.

## Attracting Builders Starts With Better Primitives

Builders don’t choose chains because of slogans.
They choose chains because certain things are *possible* there.

By offering native or easily integrated **proof of randomness in crypto**, blockchains signal:
- You can build serious games here  
- You can launch fair mints here  
- You can scale without compromising integrity  

That’s how ecosystems form—not through grants alone, but through primitives that reduce risk and expand design space.

## The Strategic Takeaway for Blockchains

If your chain wants:
- Higher fee revenue  
- More high-TPS DApps  
- Stickier developer adoption  

Then **onchain randomness isn’t optional infrastructure**—it’s core economic plumbing.

That’s the problem RANDAO is built to solve.
