**At RANDAO, we’ve seen the same buyer journey repeat across chains trying to attract serious GameFi and NFT builders.**  
It’s not about randomness for randomness’ sake. It’s about **unlocking demand**.

---

## Awareness: “We Need More DApps”  
*The pressure point where growth stalls.*

This phase starts with pressure, not curiosity.  
BizDev leads and CEOs realize that **more DApps mean more users, more transactions, and more revenue**.  
The CTO quickly hits a wall: many of the most valuable **GameFi and NFT primitives require onchain randomness**. Without it, entire categories of applications simply won’t deploy.

---

## Consideration: “Build or Buy?”  
*The cost, security, and feasibility debate.*

Here, the conversation becomes financial and operational.  
The CTO understands that **building a secure blockchain RNG in-house is non-trivial and costly**.  
The CFO wants predictability: ongoing costs, long-term maintenance, and ROI.  
Meanwhile, the CSO evaluates **security-first options** — this is where **verifiable randomness** and trust enter the room, and where **RANDAO** often first appears on the radar.

---

## Decision: “Trust, Demand, and ROI Align”  
*Where infrastructure becomes a revenue decision.*

This is the inflection point.  
The CTO doesn’t trust **Chainlink VRF** as a one-size-fits-all answer.  
The CSO has now seen **RANDAO in production** and understands its security model.  
BizDev is pushing hard — they have **10× DApps explicitly asking for RNG support**.  
And the CFO connects the dots: **investing in RANDAO directly enables new GameFi and NFT launches**, which drives measurable chain revenue.

---

## Infrastructure Is a Growth Lever  
*Why onchain randomness matters.*

**Onchain randomness isn’t just a technical feature — it’s ecosystem fuel.**  
When chains fund RNG at the protocol level, they remove friction for builders and accelerate adoption where it matters most.

This buyer journey was sharpened with help from [Founders Institute](https://fi.co/) during their accelerator program, and it continues to show up across every serious ecosystem conversation we have.

*If you’re a builder or chain executive navigating this decision right now, let’s compare notes.*
