## RANDAO Product Plan: Maximizing Randomness to Unlock Blockchain Revenue

We are unlocking increased revenue for blockchains and DApps by delivering secure, scalable, verifiable randomness.

### For chains: more gas fees  
Secure, **verifiable randomness** enables GameFi, NFT minting, raffles, auctions, and probabilistic mechanisms that simply don’t exist otherwise.  
More viable DApps → more transactions → more gas fees.

### For DApps: more usage  
Fair outcomes and provable integrity drive trust.  
Trust drives retention, volume, and monetization.  
This is how **proof of randomness in crypto** becomes a business primitive.

## Our execution strategy

We don’t win by explaining randomness better.  
We win by making it impossible *not* to use.

### Developer experience as the growth engine  
Our platform is built developer-first:
- Copy-paste integrations  
- Production-ready templates  
- Short, focused video guides  
- A dedicated DX site designed to get teams live fast  

If randomness is hard to integrate, it won’t scale. We remove that friction.

### Omni-chain by default  
Randomness should never be the reason a chain or DApp can’t ship.  
RANDAO is deployed across every EVM we can support — meeting builders where they already are.

### Partner DApp add-ons  
When a DApp integrates RANDAO, they don’t integrate alone.  
We bring our partners with us to every new chain:
- More DApp deployments  
- More usage  
- More chain fee revenue  

This is how **blockchain RNG** compounds across ecosystems.

## The product lens going forward

Every roadmap decision answers one question:  
Does this increase the amount of usable randomness delivered to real DApps?

If yes, we build it.  
If not, it waits.

That focus is how infrastructure scales.
