# Building to $1M ARR: The Weekly Operating System Behind Randao

## Big outcomes don’t come from big plans — they come from small, repeatable systems.
At Randao, our 2026 goal is clear: **$1M ARR**.  
What matters more than the number is the operating cadence we’re using to get there.

## The 5-Vertical Weekly Strategy
Think of Randao as a small city. Every week, each department has a job to do — no exceptions.

We plan and execute across five strategic verticals:
- Development  
- Research  
- Marketing  
- Business Development  
- Finance  

Each vertical has a **weekly definition of progress**, not a vague roadmap promise.

## Research: Turning Curiosity Into Assets
Research is where long-term leverage is created.

Weekly focus:
- Writing research papers  
- Defining protocols and equations  
- Creating intuitive technical diagrams  
- Testing and validating results

Building credibility as thought leaders in blockchain randomness.

## Development: Shipping Is the Strategy
Development isn’t “working on things.” It’s shipping.

Weekly focus:
- Publishing milestones  
- Celebrating milestones (momentum matters)  
- Refining the product story  
- Sprint planning  
- Demos  

Every week starts with a goal and ends with a demo.

## Marketing
The best marketing for deep tech is proof.

Weekly focus:
- Written technical articles  
- Founder-led growth posts  
- A weekly marketing plan  
- Scheduled posts  
- Cross-platform engagement  

Utilizing the results of our research and development to fuel content that builds credibility and attracts clients.

## Business Development: Compounding Relationships
Sales isn’t a funnel — it’s a feedback loop.

Weekly focus:
- Pipeline review  
- BD outreach  
- Multiple touchpoints  
- Demo scheduling  
- Continuous customer discovery  

Every conversation sharpens the protocol, the positioning, or both.

## Why This Works
Most startups optimize for speed or rigor.  
We optimize for **cadence**.

A weekly operating system:
- Reduces decision fatigue  
- Forces clarity  
- Compounds learning  
- Keeps builders and executives aligned

This is how trustless infrastrure is built, developing openly, building credibility, and fosterding relationships.
