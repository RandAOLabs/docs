## Where the RANDAO team is strongest

### Vision  
We saw the **onchain randomness problem** early—before it had a name, before it had a market.  
That long-term perspective guides every architectural and strategic decision.

### Innovation  
Our work sits at the intersection of cryptography, distributed systems, and economic incentives.  
Research doesn’t live in isolation—it ships.

### Organization  
Early-stage speed only works if chaos is contained.  
Clear ownership, documented decisions, and intentional process keep us moving fast without breaking trust.

### Execution  
Ideas are cheap. Deployed systems are not.  
We prioritize shipping, testing, and iterating over theoretical perfection.

### Marketing  
Complex systems only create value if people understand them.  
We invest heavily in explaining **verifiable randomness** in clear, non-academic terms.

## Where we’re intentionally building next

Strong foundations reveal their own gaps as load increases.

### Product  
As adoption grows, product leadership becomes less about features and more about **usage clarity** and developer experience.

### Business Development  
Partnerships don’t scale accidentally.  
We’re expanding our ability to form durable relationships with chains, protocols, and ecosystem leaders.

### Financial  
Infrastructure demands discipline.  
Long-term sustainability requires tighter financial modeling and capital planning as revenue scales.

### Customer Success  
As more teams rely on blockchain RNG in production, success shifts from onboarding to long-term reliability and trust.
