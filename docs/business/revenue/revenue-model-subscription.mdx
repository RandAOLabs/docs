RANDAO subscriptions are designed to make randomness frictionless and ubiquitous.

Early infrastructure made developers pay per use:
- Per oracle call  
- Per API request  
- Per random number  

That works — until it doesn’t.

It creates friction.
It punishes experimentation.
It turns core infrastructure into a tax.

We’re now seeing a shift toward **protocol-funded infrastructure**:
- Chains pay once  
- Every app inherits the capability  
- Builders focus on products, not plumbing  

Randomness is following the same path as:
- Oracles  
- Data availability  
- Compute  

From optional add-on → **native capability**.

## Why This Matters for Executives and Protocol Designers

If you’re designing a Layer 1 or Layer 2, ask yourself:

What should every application on my chain get for free?

If the answer includes:
- Fair games  
- Secure mints  
- Trust-minimized lotteries  
- Reliable simulations  

Then **blockchain RNG** isn’t optional.

It’s infrastructure.

And infrastructure decisions compound.

## Where This Is Going

In the next few years, we’ll stop asking:
“How does this dApp get randomness?”

And start asking:
“Why doesn’t this chain provide it by default?”

That’s the moment randomness stops being a feature — and becomes a foundation.
