One of the earliest ways we validated demand at RANDAO was straightforward:

DApps pay each time they request verifiable randomness.

It’s similar to cloud pricing:
- Clear usage
- Easy billing
- Immediate value

This model works especially well for:
- GameFi mechanics
- NFT minting events

But like most early infrastructure models, it has tradeoffs:
- Usage can be spiky
- Stickiness depends on integration depth
- Pricing pressure exists as alternatives emerge

That’s okay.

Early models aren’t about perfection.  
They’re about learning where value truly concentrates.

## The Bigger Picture: Randomness as Infrastructure

The long-term opportunity isn’t just selling randomness calls.

It’s making **randomness native** to blockchains the same way:
- Compute
- Storage
- And consensus are native today

When randomness becomes infrastructure-level:
- Builders stop reinventing fragile solutions
- Security improves by default
- Entire new design spaces open up

That’s the direction we’re building toward.
